a|[underline]#**IHO Definition** :# The Stage of Melt describes the stages of the melting ice. Puddle: An accumulation of water on ice, mainly due to the melting of snow, but in some more advanced stages also the melting of ice. Thaw Hole: Vertical holes formed in ice when surface puddles melt through to the underlying water. Dried Ice: Ice surface from which water has disappeared after the formation of cracks and thaw holes. During the process of drying the surface whitens. Rotten Ice:                     Ice which has become honey-combed and is in an advanced state of disintegration. Flooded Ice:                   Ice which has been flooded and is heavily loaded by water or water and wet snow. Frozen Puddle: A puddle which has frozen over. +
